                        We have booked with The Travel Guide for the last few trips and it has been a wonderful experience! We give them the destination and they take care of all our needs, it's a breeze!

                        <br>
                        The Travel guide took care of our every need even when we requested a place not mentioned on their website. They booked our hotel, gave us transportation options and 
                        provided us with the best options to eat in town! They even merged two options in one! They planned our vacation and booked us a spot at the local food festival.

                        I stumbled across this site when I was trying to book my last vacation. I sent an email and thought I'd just give it a shot. Wow! Let me say, this has been like striking gold! No longer do I need 
                        to sit and plan all the little details. I just pick a location and date and it feels like my vacation has already began! I just get the details, show up, and ENJOY!
